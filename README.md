# pong
Created a local co-op game of pong.
It allows a left and right paddle, representing player 1 and 2 respectively, to be moved up and based on user input (w/s keys vs. up/down arrow keys).
The ball starts in the center of the screen and randomly picks one of the diagonals to start moving.
Players must move their paddles up or down (within screen limits) to prevent the ball from reaching their end of the screen. If the ball gets past the paddle, the opponent gains a point.
Player 1 and 2's scores are always displayed at the top and update accordingly.
There is also a sound that plays when the ball collides with the top/bottom of the screen or one of the paddles.
